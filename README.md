End of the year two player fighting game in Java

For our end of the year project my partner and I chose to create a two player 2D fighting game.
There are multiple stationary and moving platforms that the players can chose to fight on, as well as multiple characters to chose from and multiple attacks to chose from.

We wrote this in java.
